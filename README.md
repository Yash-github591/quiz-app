This is a mern stack application which is running locally. As of now it is not hosted but I am trying to host this app.

to start this app:-

1. go to the api folder, execute the following command: node index.js
2. go to the client folder, execute the following command: npm start

By following these steps, the app is expected to start. I will keep updating the app by adding new features and removing bugs as much as I can.
